Web commands are another way to access GM commands that don't have an in-game chat feature in the game or if you play on a GIO server that doesn't have `ayaka bot` and is easier to use because it is equipped with a handbook so you don't have to bother looking for item IDs .

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have an account, you can log-in/register first at https://ps.yuuki.me/account/login 

   > Warning: you must have the same account as in the game, you cannot log in with a different account.

2. After you have successfully logged in ([Manager Account](https://ps.yuuki.me/account/home)), what you need to pay attention to is the `UID Account`, `Code (API Access` and `Current Password (In-Web)` sections, just ignore the warning marked in red.

3. If you have managed to find it, now you focus on the `Code (API Access)` section, here you can fill in `4 numbers` such as `1212` (remember this is an example, use your own numbers if you don't want to be exposed to hackers) (you can use tool `Generator` feature to create `4 numbers`)

4. If `4 digits` for your code are ready (already filled in), please focus on the `Current Password (In-Web)` section. In this section you only need to retype your password when registering or logging in on this website. If it continues to be wrong, you can go to the 'Forgot password' section

5. Now you just need to press the `save` button, to save the current settings

6. Task here is complete, you can return to https://ps.yuuki.me/command or https://gm.elaxan.com/

7. In this section you only need to retype your `Code` and `Account UID`, then click login.

   > Info: player data will always be updated every 1 hour so if you still haven't found the player data on the server you want please wait another 1 hour then log in to the web command.
