## Getting Started

1. Download Launcher For Android: [GI](/game/genshin-impact), [SR](/game/star-rail).
2. After you download, you can immediately install the apk like a normal application, nothing special.
3. After you install it, you can open it and log in with your [YuukiPS Account](/account/home), after that the game data will automatically download so you don't need to manually download game data anymore.

## Info
We do not recommend manually copying game data on Android 12+ versions, even if it is done via PC or Root, because it will damage your game data and cause the game to experience incorrect game size detection. The best way is to simply install the apk then download the game data in-game.
