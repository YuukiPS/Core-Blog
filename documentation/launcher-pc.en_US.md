To connect to our server you can use the launcher which is made specifically for private servers with this you have already done the patch and proxy so you don't need anything else. currently PC Launcher is available in two options:

### YuukiPS Launcher

1. Download [Launcher YuukiPS](https://github.com/YuukiPS/Launcher-PC/releases/download/2024.1.1.1352/YuukiPS.zip).
2. Extract zip to a folder, anywhere as long as you have enough storage space. (`NEVER RUN INSIDE A ZIP OR CLOUD STORAGE LIKE ONEDRIVE`)
3. Before you run it, make sure the antivirus or Windows firewall is off or `put it in the except list` because Microsoft often gives false warnings because the file was created without Microsoft verification and because cheats are injected stuff which Microsoft doesn't like.
4. After you open it (if you are asked to update please click yes), after that the launcher will try to detect your game, if it doesn't work, do the next step. (Because the private server currently `doesn't support 4.3.0`, automatic detection should tell you to Download Full Version ([GI GC 4.0.1, GI GIO 3.2.0](/game/genshin-impact), [SR LC 2.0.0](/game/star-rail)), yep, that's right, you have to do it.)
5. After you have successfully downloaded the game data which is around 60gb in size and unzip the game data file anywhere and make sure you remember the game folder.
6. In the `Game config` tab > `Game Folder` please click `Select` and look for your game folder (make sure game folder is still using version 4.0.1/4.0.0, not 4.3.0. If it still hasn't been downloaded, it will give you a warning) (MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT SELECT FOLDER `XXX_Data` aka `GenshinImpact_Data` THIS IS WRONG, YOU MUST SELECT THE MAIN GAME FOLDER NOT THE SUB FOLDER.)
7. If this is first time you click `Launcher` you will be given a prompt to install SSL aka CA (Certificate) just click yes, after that try closing application first then open it again then click `Launcer` again.
8. At this point you are finished, if you successfully enter private server you will only see Twitter without Google,Facebook Login Logo.
9. If you log in successfully, it will automatically download another 13gb or so of English voices, it's normal so just let it finish.

### Cultivation

1. Download [Launcher Cultivation by NotThorny](https://github.com/NotThorny/Cultivation/releases/download/1.3.0/Cultivation_1.3.0_x64_en-US.msi).
2. After you have finished downloading, open the installation then click `Next` then `Next` then `Install` (Make sure you are an administrator)
3. After installation is complete, try clicking the `Launch Cultivation` checklist then clicking `Finish`, it will automatically open application, if it doesn't open automatically you can open it on desktop.
4. First time you will get a popup message about SSL aka CA (Certificate) which says `Security Warning` just click `YES` it is safe because we are switching official network to a private server.
5. From here you can see launcher ui, click `settings icon` (you can find it at the top right near minimize button), in `Set Game install Path` please set game folder, remember our server only supports `4.0.1 so 4.3.0 for GI` and `2.0.0 for SR` doesn't work so you have to Download Full Version ([GI GC 4.0.1, GI GIO 3.2.0](/game/genshin-impact), [SR LC 2.0.0](/game/star-rail)) then extract and set it to folder you already extracted. (Additionally for SR, MAKE SURE YOU CHECKLIST `Also redirect other MHY games` so it can work.)
6. close settings, then check `connect to grasscutter` and `Use HTTPS`, then replace `localhost` with `ps.yuuki.me` then click launch.
7. At this point you are finished, if you successfully enter private server you will only see Twitter without Google,Facebook Login Logo.
8. If you log in successfully, it will automatically download another 13gb or so of English voices, it's normal so just let it finish.
