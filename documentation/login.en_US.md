Registering or logging in to YuukiPS is actually quite simple, you only need to input (any username, however you still have to remember it) and (any password, because it's not important). and if account is already registered it will automatically log in, and if account has never been registered it will automatically register and then log in automatically. 

> But registering via in-game can only be done once a day, so you have to register on our site!!!

## How to Register

1. Please register at https://ps.yuuki.me/account/register?type=web

   > Warning: You need to remember, you have to remember your `In-Web Password` because this is important to use later, so please don't enter it carelessly. and the email must be an email that can be used because this is important. If you forget your password, you can reset the password using your email.
